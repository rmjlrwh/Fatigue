# Identifying fatigue & other potential cancer symptoms in electronic health records using Read codes

# What is this for?
The purpose of this repository is to share Read code lists used in the study: "Risk of underlying cancer among patients presenting to primary care with fatigue, in combination with other vague symptoms" by Becky White, Dr. Cristina Renzi, Dr. Matthew Barclay, Prof. Georgios Lyratzopoulos.

# How was it created?
We identified fatigue and 35 additional potential cancer symptoms, based on symptoms listed in NICE NG 12 (2015) recommendations for suspected cancer and additional sources, for which Read code lists were available. 
Codes were amalgamated across sources, with minor additions by GL, CR, MB, MR, and BW. They were then deduplicated to ensure symptom definitions were mutually exclusive, and validated by clinical co-authors (GL, CR). 

# What is included?
Sources of Read code lists used to define each symptom are available in the 'Read code sources.docx' file.
The Read code lists are available as a .txt file in the Code list folder.
