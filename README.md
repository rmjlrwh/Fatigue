# Identifying fatigue & other potential cancer symptoms in electronic health records using Read codes

# What is this for?
The purpose of this repository is to share the analysis code and Read code lists used in the study: "Risk of underlying cancer among patients presenting to primary care with fatigue, in combination with other vague symptoms" by Becky White, Dr. Cristina Renzi, Dr. Matthew Barclay, Prof. Georgios Lyratzopoulos.

# How was it created?
Full methods will be available in an upcoming publication. We identified fatigue and 35 additional potential cancer symptoms, based on symptoms listed in NICE NG 12 (2015) recommendations for suspected cancer and additional sources, for which Read code lists were available. 
Codes were amalgamated across sources, with minor additions by GL, CR, MB, MR, and BW. They were then deduplicated to ensure symptom definitions were mutually exclusive, and validated by clinical co-authors (GL, CR).
